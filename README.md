Building client's portfolio with React
# Client Portfolio

I built my client's portfolio using HTML, CSS, React and NPM (Node Package Manager)

This client is a fashion stylist and wanted a portfolio to display mostly images. I thought I'd build something similar to the Instagram interface as I think the social app handles images the best today
